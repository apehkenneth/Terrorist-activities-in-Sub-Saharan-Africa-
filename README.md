# Terrorist activities in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) between 1970 and 2019
The dataset is for terrorist activities in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) between 1970 and 2019. The columns show various attributes in the dataset.
The main idea is to subject the dataset to machine learning models to train the data and use the same for predicting future terrorist occurrences.

Overall objective is to intelligently use ML algorithms to predict future terrorist activities in Sub Saharan Africa (types, groups involved, places of incidents, etc) using data from the Global Terrorism Database.

The main machine learning models of interest here are: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR) and Neural Networks (NNETs).

Some of the metrics to be considered for comparing performances include: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE); Minkowski/Euclidean distance (for K-Nearest Neighbours); Jaccard Similarity coefficient (Regression); or F1 Score.
